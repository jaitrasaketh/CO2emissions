# CO2emissions

Dataset and Features:
Utilizes a vehicle dataset with features such as engine size and fuel consumption to predict CO2 emissions.

Model Training:
Implements a custom linear regression model with gradient descent for parameter optimization, alongside training a scikit-learn linear regression model for comparison.

Data Splitting:
Divides the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets to assess model performance on unseen data.

Evaluation Metrics:
Computes Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values to quantify and compare the predictive accuracy of the custom and scikit-learn models.

Visualization :
Offers an optional scatter plot visualization comparing actual and predicted CO2 emissions from both the custom and scikit-learn models.

Model Comparison:
Contrasts the performance of the custom linear regression model with a scikit-learn counterpart in terms of MSE and R-squared values.
